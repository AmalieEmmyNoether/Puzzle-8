## Is this really a problem? 

In this case, however, data suggests a shift in recent weeks, particularly among teenagers. 

In the first half of January, poison control centers handled 39 cases in which teenagers were intentionally exposed to the detergent packets.
That was as many as in all of 2016, the American Association of Poison control Centers said. Last year, poison control centers handled 53 such cases, the group said
in a new release. 

The problem is more serious for young children. Last year, centers recieved 10,570 reports of children 5 or younger being exposed to the packets, 
the group said. Details on the severity of the injuries were unavailable.
