## Dynasty won't be denied

Georgia owned Alabama in a way no opponent had during the Nick Saban era, but only for 30 minutes. While Georgia players gathered on their sideline as halftime came to a close, Alabama remained in its locker room, waiting to return to the field until just seconds remained before kickoff christened the third quarter. What did Saban say? Did he scream, yell, cajole, pray? Only one thing is certain: it worked.

Down 13-0 at the half, Alabama scored 26 points in the game’s final two quarters and one frame of overtime to shock Georgia and claim its fifth national title under Saban’s direction. On the sport’s biggest stage, against an opponent built in its own image, Alabama reminded everyone that football is more than a 30-minute game — and in doing so cemented the program’s place as the greatest dynasty to ever exist in college football.
