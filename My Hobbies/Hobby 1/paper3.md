## The spirit of the sea

Today, armed with the laws of planetary motion and of gravity, together with a slew of other calculations, scientists have identified more than 400 discrete cycles, ranging in length from only 6 hours to about 25,800 years, the time it takes for the earth’s polar axis to complete one cyclic wobble, like a gyrating top, along its axis of rotation—the so-called precession of the equinoxes.
